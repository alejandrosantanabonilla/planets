**Tutorial to use the Particle Swarm Optimization python implemention:**

**Introduction**

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking, fish schooling, or insect swarming. 
PSO is a robust and efficient optimization technique that has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in various fields, including engineering, science, and business.

This tutorial will provide a step-by-step guide on how to use the PSO implementation in Python.

**Prerequisites**

* Basic understanding of Python programming
* Familiarity with optimization algorithms

**Installation**
