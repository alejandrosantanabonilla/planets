**Tutorial to use the Particle Swarm Optimization python implemention:**

**Introduction**

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking, fish schooling, or insect swarming. 
PSO is a robust and efficient optimization technique that has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in various fields, including engineering, science, and business.

This tutorial will provide a step-by-step guide on how to use the PSO implementation in Python.

**Prerequisites**

* Basic understanding of Python programming
* Familiarity with optimization algorithms

**Installation Process:**

Before proceeding with the tutorial, ensure that you have installed the necessary libraries, including:

* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* tqdm
* json
* PIL

**Installing Dependencies:**

To insall libraries such as NumPy, JSON, tqdm, and PIL please use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install numpy
   pip install json   
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install json
   pip install Pillow
   pip install tqdm

**Note:** Make sure you have pip installed on your system. If not, you can install it using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-pip

**Example:**

An example can be run directly after the code has been downloaded and libraries have been installed. 


**Conclusion**

This tutorial provides a basic implementation of PSO in Python. For more advanced applications, you can explore 
various extensions and modifications of the algorithm in terms of new inertia functions, velocity clamping 
among others.
