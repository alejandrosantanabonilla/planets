# Cluster formation

In this repository there are two codes: **mc_random.py** and **random_coord.py**. The fist code generates a set of random coordinates and compute single-point energies.
These energies are then evolved using a MC approach to try to get the global minimum. The second code explains and visualises how the random coordinates are generated
within a circle. 

# Task

Please check that all the coordinates are fulfilling the threshold of minimum distance.
